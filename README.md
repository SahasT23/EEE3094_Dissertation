# To add for MOVG

## Urgent
* Need to fix JSON issue, (explain path logic as well - probably add a separate parser/function to look at this, maybe change decomposition logic? (risky)). Need to add Numba speed up as well. 
* Test on S&P500 data and VIX data (look at signature outputs)
* Design poster (due 27/10/2025)

## Do later
* Add NaN, missing values for MOVG output.
* Need to add examples where a dataset has a slight difference (one point is slightly higher or lower in nearly identical time series data). Need to add signature outputs and see what it would look like, compare with previous outputs.
* Need to write report as well, along with documentation. 
* Need to clean up code and then convert to library to use for future work. 

## Do if you have time
* In the future: Multivariate MOVG (December)
* Motif based prediction (Ekin's idea)
* Use other concepts from graph theory -- this includes clustering coefficients etc. 
* Connectivity degrees, (again, Ekin's idea, will need some more thought on this)
* Start studying signatures and signature motifs,
* Design pipeline (unlikely)
* Get benchmarks with
